My first project when I came to Haugaland VGS was a pretty light chatboard made with django

I have Users and user aauthentication wich I made all by myself

Everything is made with Django and no 3rd party libraries

I have used django's ORM instead of Their REST-API

Har brukt Django sin Standard Django-HTML og standard Css for frontend.

Hvis eg skulle lagt noke likt dette i framtiden så hadde eg brukt Django sin REST API å koblet den opp til en Next Js frontend.
