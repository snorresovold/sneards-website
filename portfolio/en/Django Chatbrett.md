My first project when I came to Haugaland VGS was a pretty light chatboard made with django

I have Users and user aauthentication wich I made all by myself

Everything is made with Django and no 3rd party libraries

I have used django's ORM instead of Their REST-API

I have used Django HTML and css for a basic frontend

If i were to make something like this in the future then I'd make a Django REST-API Backend and a Next JS Typescript frontend
