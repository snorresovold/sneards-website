For this project I made a "map" file in a txt that i process and use to generate the map, a program runs through each letter in the file and uses them to generate blocks in the game D=dirt, W=water etc. 

The pokemons are stored in JSON and of course has a bunch of different values wich makes every pokemon unique, they are made as a python object, im not a big fan of OOP but i think game design is a place where OOP shines

Since i didn't have a lot of time i made the combat in the console
